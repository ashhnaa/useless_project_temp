### Project Description
Our project is an irreverent twist on tarot reading, offering a "nonsense" experience where, no matter which card users click, they‚Äôre met with the same bold image of a tarot card featuring a middle finger up. This single-image reveal adds a humorous surprise, turning the act of selecting any card into a playful mockery of traditional fortune-telling.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Future Prediction using Tarots

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Selecting a card from the deck gives you a single, irreverent outcome, stripping away any pressure to interpret meanings and playfully mocking the idea of destiny itself.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- SVG
